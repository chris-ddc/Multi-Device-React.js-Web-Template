# Multi-Device React.js Web Template

## Overview
The **Multi-Device React.js Web Template** is a boilerplate designed to help developers build web applications that provide tailored layouts and functionality for different device types, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. By using device-specific rendering logic, this template allows for a more precise and optimized user experience across various platforms.

---

## Features
- **Device-Specific Rendering**: Automatically detects the device type and renders unique components for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Customizable Breakpoints**: Easily adjust screen width thresholds for detecting different device types.
- **Modern React Setup**: Utilizes React.js functional components and hooks for a clean and efficient development experience.
- **Ready-to-Use File Structure**: Organized folder structure to simplify adding new screens or components.

*Note*: Navigation functionality is not included and will need to be set up separately. Libraries like `react-router-dom` are recommended for implementing navigation.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chris-ddc/Multi-Device-React.js-Web-Template.git
cd Multi-Device-React.js-Web-Template
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then run:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server
Start the app in development mode:
```bash
npm start
```
This will open the app in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 4. Build for Production
To create an optimized production build:
```bash
npm run build
```
The production-ready files will be in the `build/` directory.

## File Structure

```plaintext
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ Desktop/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Screens/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Dhome.js         # Desktop-specific component
â”œâ”€â”€ Mobile/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Screens/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Mhome.js         # Mobile-specific component
â”œâ”€â”€ Tablet/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Screens/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Thome.js         # Tablet-specific component
â”œâ”€â”€ App.js                   # Core application logic
â”œâ”€â”€ index.js                 # Entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ index.css                # Global styles
â””â”€â”€ reportWebVitals.js       # Performance reporting (optional)
```

## How It Works

### Device Detection
The application uses the `window.innerWidth` property to determine the current screen width and dynamically render the appropriate component:
- **Desktop (`Dhome`)**: Renders when the width is greater than 1024px.
- **Tablet (`Thome`)**: Renders when the width is between 768px and 1024px.
- **Mobile (`Mhome`)**: Renders when the width is less than 768px.

### Code Overview
Hereâ€™s the main logic in `App.js`:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import Dhome from './Desktop/Screens/Dhome';
import Mhome from './Mobile/Screens/Mhome';
import Thome from './Tablet/Screens/Thome';

function App() {
  const [windowWidth, setWindowWidth] = useState(window.innerWidth);

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => {
      setWindowWidth(window.innerWidth);
    };

    window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {windowWidth < 768 ? (
        <Mhome />
      ) : windowWidth >= 768 && windowWidth <= 1024 ? (
        <Thome />
      ) : (
        <Dhome />
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Customization

### Adjusting Breakpoints
To change the breakpoints:
1. Open `App.js`.
2. Modify the `if` conditions in the return block to fit your requirements.

### Adding New Components
1. Create a new component in the appropriate folder (`Desktop`, `Mobile`, or `Tablet`).
2. Import the component into `App.js` and add the rendering logic as needed.

## FAQ

### 1. Why use device-specific components instead of responsive CSS?
This template is ideal for applications where each device requires unique layouts, interactions, or functionality. It complements traditional responsive design by offering tailored experiences.

### 2. Do I need any additional libraries?
No additional libraries are required. The template is built using plain React.js. However, you can extend it with libraries like `react-router-dom` for navigation or `styled-components` for styling.

### 3. How can I test it?
Resize your browser window or use browser developer tools to simulate different screen sizes.
